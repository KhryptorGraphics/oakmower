# Problem statement
Lawn mowing is a time-consuming and tiring routine household task. In recent years it has become one of the main personal robot applications. But even high-end products still require the expensive installation of boundary wires to ensure that the robot stays on the lawn. However, even with sich wires limiting the lawn area, numerous problems can occur, including the bot
* killing small animals such as hedgehogs,
* hurting children,
* driving into molehills and
* crashing into "unwired" obstacles such as trees.

Proper abstacle detection for mowing bots can save lives, money and the bot itself. The aim is to prove that this can be achieved using the OpenCV AI Kit with Depth (OAK-D).
